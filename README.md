# Avis Telemetry

Telemetry for the [avis aeterna](https://pinchito.es/2023/avis-aeterna) project.
The Avis telemetry API is intended to receive telemetry data from devices,
and store remote configurations.
This should make it easier to access data from your devices,
especially if you are using an ESP32 or similar platforms which include WiFi.

## Documentation

Please check out the [API documentation](docs/api.md),
and read the [installation instructions](docs/install.md) to create your own server.
